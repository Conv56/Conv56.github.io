        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-indigo-800 mb-4">Journal Entry #1: Why <em>The Illegal</em>?</h2>
        <p>There are quite a few reasons why I chose <em>The Illegal</em> as my book, and the title has to be one of them. “Illegal” is usually a word that’s weaponized in real life, and seeing the word turned into a human story sounds extremely interesting. On top of this, Lawrence Hill is a big name, as I have read his other books like <em>The Book of Negroes</em>. I admire his style of writing, as he is great at handling themes of displacement and resistance.</p>

          <h3 class="font-semibold">Cover Versions:</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
            <li><strong>Audiobook:</strong> Minimal detail, sparks curiosity—<em>How does a running man relate to “illegal”?</em></li>
            <li><strong>Print Cover:</strong> Man under a spotlight, running on a hill—evokes tension and isolation.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="mt-4">According to summaries I read, the story follows Keita “running” for his life as an undocumented immigrant in Freedom State. With the rise of ICE and anti-immigrant policies, I’m curious whether Keita’s fate will mirror real-world debates on asylum and justice.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">First Third</h3>
            <p>Keita Ali emerges as a driven youth, obsessive about running. Hiding his “Meb Supremes” in his knapsack shows his ambition and defiance: <q>he was so in love with his Meb Supremes … he had left the house with them hidden in his knapsack</q> (Hill 13).</p>
            <p>As an adult, winning under an alias brings pride and fear: <q>Worry framed his eyes and furrowed his brow</q> when he sees his photo listed as “Roger Bannister” (Hill 144).</p>

          <div class="bg-green-100 p-4 rounded">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Second Third</h3>
            <p>In AfricTown, locals chant <q>Keita Ali, go for gold!</q> and offer oranges—giving him belonging beyond survival: <q>There was no gold to run for… Children stood by the roadside and clapped</q> (Hill 285).</p>
            <p>Mrs. Beech’s kindness after his collapse—<q>Do you know who you are? … Yes … Keita Ali</q> (Hill 206)—teaches him trust and interdependence.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-800 mb-4">Journal Entry #3: Novel Background</h2>
        <p>Lawrence Hill’s parents were civil‑rights activists: his father Daniel Hill led the Ontario Human Rights Commission; his mother Donna Hill fought anti‑discrimination law. Hill’s journalism and volunteer work, plus a childhood dream of Olympic running, shaped <em>The Illegal</em>.</p>
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-400 pl-4 italic my-4">“obscene and heartbreaking” (Hill – exact page TBD)</blockquote>
        <p>Published mid‑2010s amid a record refugee crisis—60 million displaced (UN 2015)—Hill’s fictional Zantoroland and Freedom State mirror real‑world Syria/Rwanda and ICE/Australia. AfricTown echoes Africville’s tragic history.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-800 mb-4">Journal Entry #4: Resilience</h2>
        <p>Keita’s resilience peaks when he confronts dehumanization: <q>I am not asking for mercy, Minister. I am asking for rights. I am not an animal</q> (Hill 376). His refusal reframes resilience as active defiance.</p>
        <p>Running becomes protest: hurdling barriers symbolizes resistance to unjust systems. Hill suggests personal grit combined with collective solidarity sparks social change.</p>

        <p>After his father’s kidnapping, Keita rereads Yoyo’s final words—<q>The time has come. Call the marathon agent</q> (Hill 46)—as a coping ritual, showing memory’s power amid trauma.</p>
